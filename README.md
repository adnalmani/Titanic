# Titanic Survival Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes features such as passenger age, sex, ticket class, and more.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in this project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
- `models/`: Saved models and configurations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. This project uses several libraries and tools that are specified in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes the following files:
- `train.csv`: Training data.
- `test.csv`: Test data for predictions.
- `gender_submission.csv`: Example of the format for submitting predictions.

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and place them in the `data/` directory.

### Running the Analysis

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Open `notebooks/eda_notebook.ipynb` to explore and visualize the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
   - Run `scripts/preprocess.py` to clean and preprocess the data.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Execute `scripts/train_model.py` to train different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

4. **Making Predictions:**
   - Use `scripts/predict.py` to generate predictions on the test set.

5. **Submission:**
   - Format your predictions according to `gender_submission.csv` and submit them to Kaggle.

## Results

The results of different models, including accuracy scores and feature importances, are documented in `notebooks/model_comparison.ipynb`.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. If you have suggestions or improvements, open an issue to discuss potential changes.
